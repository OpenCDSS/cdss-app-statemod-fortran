# Development Environment / Text Editor #

The [Eclipse/Photran IDE](eclipse) is one option for editing code and performing other development tasks.
However, some developers may prefer to avoid Eclipse and instead use a test editor.
Text editors are useful in general for some operations.
The StateMod development environment is configured to accommodate both options.
Text editors that are known to be used with StateMod are discussed below.
