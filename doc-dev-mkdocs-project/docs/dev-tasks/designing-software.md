# Development Tasks / Designing Software

**TODO smalers 2017-01-02 need to add content here about how to work with the OpenCDSS team to

Perhaps use GitHub issues and GitHub projects page as the interface to the StateCU software project.**

See the [Software Design](../software-design/overview/) documentation.
