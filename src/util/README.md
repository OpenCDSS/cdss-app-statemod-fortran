# util

This folder contains StateMod utility programs.
These programs perform useful tasks on StateMod datasets.
Equivalent functionality may also be possible using tools such as StateDMI and TSTool.

As of 2021-06-21, the status of the utilities is not known.
The programs have traditionally been compiled with Lahey Fortran compiler.
Additional work is necessary to compile the programs with `gfortran`.

The files in the repository may contain extra files.
Log files and other output files have been removed since they can be recreated.
