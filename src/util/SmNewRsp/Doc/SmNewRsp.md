## Introduction

The program `SmNewRsp` reads an old (version 1-10) StateMod response file and creates a new one in the currently supported format (version 11 and greater).

## Program Description

`SmNewRsp` is a preprocessing program that converts outdated (version 1-10) StateMod response file to a new (version 11 and greater) StateMod response file.
The new format allows files to be provided in any order using a file descriptor.
As presented below, `SmNewRsp` keys on the suffix recommended and typically used in an existing StateMod response file to
build a response file that is consistent with version 11 and greater.
If any existing file that does not contain a standard,
recommended suffix `SmNewRsp` will warn the user but will not try to determine the file type.
In such a case the results of `SmNewRsp` typically require hand editing before they can be successfully used by StateMod.
To execute `SmNewRsp`:

```
SmNewRsp flname.rsp 
```

where `flname.rsp` is an old (version 1-10) StateMod response.
The new response file is named `SmNewRsp.out`.
Messages are written to the log file named `SmNewRsp.log`.

## Input File Description

Program input is an old format respose file, specified as the command parameter.

## Output File Description

`SmNewRsp` creates a log file and a StateMod new (version 11 and greater) format.

## Comments and Concerns

Following are comments and concerns associated with the preprocessor `SmNewRsp`:

* The old StateMod response file required dummy files be provided if a particular data type is not used.
Accordingly, `SmNewRsp` ignores any files with a `*.dum` file extension.
