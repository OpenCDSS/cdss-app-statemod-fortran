# doc-dev-doxygen-project #

The Doxygen software creates a graph of routine calls by examining the source code.
The resulting stand-alone website is useful to understand relationships between code modules.
The output is NOT a flowchart but does help understand code complexity and calling sequence.

## Installing Doxygen ##

Install the Doxygen software as per the StateMod developers documentation.

## Running Doxygen ##

To run Doxygen and create output, run the `build-util/run-doxygen.sh` script from Git Bash or other Linux shell.
Follow the instructions displayed by the script.
Output will be created in a folder named `doxygen-statemod-VERSION` where `VERSION` is taken from the
`statem.for` file.
A new output folder will be created if the version is changed.
The output is ignored in `.gitignore` file in this folder and is therefore not stored in the repository.

## Viewing Documentation ##

Documentation generated by Doxygen can be viewed the following ways:

1. Use the ***Show HTML output*** in the Doxygen ***Run*** tab.
2. Use a web browser to open the `html/index.html` file in the versioned output folder.

## Publishing Documentation ##

The Doxygen output is copied to the Colorado DNR Google Cloud Platform site by running
the script `copy-to-co-dnr-gcp.bat`.
This allows the documentation to be viewed by the public.
